Data from experiments executed on top of the k8s-openmpi repository code.

# Experiments
* Running Container-Based MPI Cluster on shared hosts â€“ the MPI cluster consist of four container nodes each running in compliance with host-bound anti-affinity rule guaranteeing that the Kubernetes scheduler will place and maintain each one of the nodes on a separate container platform host.
* Running Container-Based MPI Cluster on exclusive hosts - the MPI cluster consist of four container nodes running in compliance with host-bound affinity rule guaranteeing that the Kubernetes scheduler will place and maintain every two of the nodes on a same container platform host.
